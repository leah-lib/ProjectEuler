#The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

#41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
#This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.

#The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

#Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?
